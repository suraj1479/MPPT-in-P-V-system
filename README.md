# MPPT-in-P-V-system
Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is a technique used primarily in photovoltaic (solar) systems to maximize power extraction under all conditions.

Solar panels have a complex relationship between their output power and the voltage and current they produce. MPPT technology continuously monitors the voltage and current output of the panels and adjusts the electrical operating point to ensure the system operates at its maximum power point, thus improving efficiency and energy harvest. MPPT is typically implemented in the charge controllers of solar power systems.
